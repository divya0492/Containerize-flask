Step 1: Choose a Flask Application
Select a Flask-based web server application from GitHub or any other source. 

Step 2: Create a Dockerfile
In order to containerize the Flask application, you need to create a Dockerfile. The Dockerfile will define the instructions for building the Docker image.

Step 3: Build and Push the Docker Image

To build the image locally, open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile. Then run the following command:

docker build -t flask-app:latest .


After the image is built, we  can push it to a container registry, such as Docker Hub or a private registry. 

Step 4: Set up Kubernetes Cluster
Set up a Kubernetes cluster using your preferred method. 

Ensure that we  have kubectl configured to communicate with the Kubernetes cluster.

Step 5: Create Kubernetes Deployment and Service Manifests

Create Kubernetes manifests to deploy the Flask application . The manifests should include a Deployment for the Flask application, a Service to expose it.
